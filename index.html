<p>
The vegetation of the Red Savannah Ecological Site developed under a humid sub-tropical climate on plains or terraces on hills. Periodic long droughts, frequent fire and grazing or browsing by endemic and nomadic wildlife helped shape the reference plant community as found by pioneers in the Texas Central Basin. The sub-tropical humid climate, coming primarily as convective storms during the warm season, favored deep-rooted vegetation. Trees, tallgrasses and shrubs were scattered along draws and deeper soil areas where soil moisture conditions are above average. Midgrasses dominated the plain and hill slope areas. The resulting reference plant community of the Red Savannah Ecological Site is a Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) with tallgrasses, midgrasses, shortgrasses, perennial forbs and scattered trees.
